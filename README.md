# Flask Excel Data Manager

This project is a Flask-based web application designed for secure uploading and management of Excel data. It integrates user authentication and leverages MongoDB for efficient data storage, providing a seamless experience for users to upload, preview, and confirm their Excel data in a secure environment.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure login system to manage user sessions.
- **Excel Upload**: Users can upload Excel files (.xlsx) and preview their content.
- **Data Preview**: Before finalizing the upload, users can review the data.
- **Secure Data Storage**: Confirmed uploads are stored in MongoDB, with data organized in user-specific collections.
